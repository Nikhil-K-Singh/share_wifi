# Wifi Sharing

QR code generation for users to directly scan and connect to a wifi network.


Inspired by https://qifi.org/   , https://qrcodemakr.com/ and    https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/encoding-wifi-access-point-passwords-qr-code/


###  Improvements

Cross Platform functionality ; currently only supports windows systems,
will be adding linux and other platforms in the generation.
